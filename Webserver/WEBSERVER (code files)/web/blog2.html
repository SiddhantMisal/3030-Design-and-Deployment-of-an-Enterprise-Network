                        The image , Iguazu Falls on the border of Brazil and Argentina, would not have been
                        possible without the help of a neutral density filter. Here is the exposure data from this
                        image: 4.0 seconds, f/22, ISO 100, 6-stop ND filter. The correct exposure data without the ND
                        filter would have been the same except for the shutter speed, which would have been 1/15 of a
                        second (6 stops faster). As you can see, I am already at the smallest f-stop (f/22) and the
                        lowest ISO (100) possible for my camera and lens.
                    </p>
                    <p>There’s nothing else I can do in camera to slow things down to achieve the desired effect.
                        Without the ND filter, the correct exposure would have been 1/8 second so a 4-second exposure
                        would have badly overexposed the image. There is simply no way to create the smooth, silky water
                        I desired under those bright, sunny skies without the ND filter absorbing some of the light that
                        was reaching my camera’s sensor. Unless, of course, I wished to wait for less intense light once
                        the sun went down or a cloud passed overhead. But then there’s that pretty little rainbow I
                        would have missed.<br>

                        Being lost is often cited as one the four most crippling human fears. And while technological
                        progress has made little headway with death, heights, and public speaking, it has nearly
                        succeeded in reducing the art of getting lost into a lost art. GPS devices, smart phones, and
                        navigation apps with talking virtual assistants can get us from Point A to Point B with ruthless
                        efficiency while offering little about where we are in the world, figuratively speaking.</p>
                    <p>
                        According to cognitive scientists, getting lost is an essential part of how we grow and develop
                        as humans. Whether it’s in a big, sprawling city like Havana, a forest, or a good book or movie,
                        losing oneself, even for the briefest of moments, is good for the mind and the soul. Aside from
                        the state of being lost, there’s the added benefit of getting unlost at some point, a practice
                        that draws on exercising one’s intuition, reasoning skills, and memory recall. Making mental
                        maps and establishing spatial awareness using landmarks and physical cues – instead of relying
                        solely on technology’s cold, clinical instructions – are important cognitive functions that are
                        quickly becoming lost, for lack of a better word, in today’s digital age.

                        Every home has one or more such features which can make it stand out from the rest. Hence, these
                        are the special features that you have to use to capture the buyer’s interest. It does not have
                        to be a big thing, but even a few small features will be sufficient.

                        For instance, maybe your house has a good porch or a wide backyard. Similarly, it might have a
                        lot of greenery around it. Therefore, whatever feature makes your home different from others,
                        enhance it in the video. You can simply do this by increasing the lighting at that point and
                        capturing these from several positions. It is then possible to add all of these different
                        perspectives to the video and present them to the client.</p>

                        The winter season is mostly spent guiding photography workshops in the picturesque areas of
                        Northern
                        Norway and along the Arctic Borders. This is a highlight of the year as I get to help
                        like-minded
                        people capture beautiful images of some of the world’s most amazing landscapes.

                            inear Perspective is an important concept in photography, and an element of photo
                            composition, it is about how you can capture a three-dimensional scene and present it in a
                            photo with only a two-dimensional plane.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Perspective is the spatial relationship between objects within an image. Perspective is a
                            way to make a two-dimensional photograph feel like a three-dimensional scene.

                            Using perspective techniques can give an impression of depth to your photo and make a scene
                            look more realistic.

                            In other words perspective refers to how the eye sees objects relating to one another. It is
                            also used to describe the position and direction from which the image is taken.
                        </p>
                        <p>Linear perspective is the most common type of perspective photography, and the one most
                            familiar to photographers. Linear perspective occurs when two parallel lines seem to
                            converge as they get farther away from the viewer. Our brain knows that they are parallel
                            and therefore never touch, but they appear to. So, they must be getting farther away.

                            These converging lines show and emphasize the depth of a frame.

                            Linear perspective requires two elements: parallel lines and a vanishing point. A vanishing
                            point is typically on the horizon but can be placed anywhere in an image.</p>

                                “Shoot what it feels like” is great advice, but it’s low on any real actionable kind of
                                next steps. It leaves me asking how? In hindsight, I’m glad I had to figure it out
                                myself (I seem to learn better that way), but a little help along the way would have
                                been welcome. I wish someone had told me I needed to learn what we actually respond to
                                in a photograph.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The things in a photograph to which we respond. Keep that idea in mind because I’m going
                                to come back to it.

                                I don’t think there is one single thing that leads to better photographs, though Stephen
                                Shore comes close when he says: “It seems to me that a good photographer is a
                                combination of two things: one is interesting perceptions, and the other is an
                                understanding of how the world is translated by a camera into a photograph.”</p>
